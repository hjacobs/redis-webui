============
Redis Web UI
============

Really simple web-based command line interface for Redis.

Goal was to provide a web interface for users which allows restricting access (e.g. to allow read commands only).
Administration and management of Redis server(s) is out of scope.

If you are looking for a more sophisticated Redis frontend (but with less security features), try `Redis Commander`_
